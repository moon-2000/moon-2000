## Hey! I'm Amany Omar
### Computer Vision Research Engineer | Junior Data Scientist 
As a passionate Computer Vision Research Engineer and a certified Data Scientist from [365 Data Science](https://learn.365datascience.com/c/8e3dc08eac/) board, 
I specialize in leveraging cutting-edge techniques and tools to extract valuable insights from intricate datasets. Here's a breakdown of my expertise:

What I Can Do:

### Machine Learning

In the realm of Machine Learning, I excel in:

    Data Exploration, Cleaning, Preprocessing, and Manipulation: I specialize in preparing data for analysis, ensuring it's accurate, consistent, and ready for modeling.

    Building Predictive Models: From classic regression models to advanced neural networks, I develop predictive models tailored to specific tasks. I don't just stop at building; I continually optimize and maintain these models for peak performance.

    Model Deployment on Azure: I have experience deploying machine learning models on Azure, making them accessible and usable in real-world applications.

### Computer Vision

My expertise in Computer Vision spans various tasks:

    Object Detection: I utilize advanced YOLO models such as v5, v7, and v8 for accurate object detection in images and videos.

    Object Tracking: I'm skilled in implementing tracking algorithms like Kalman filter, DeepSORT, and StrongSORT to track objects over time, ensuring seamless monitoring.

    Vision Transformers for Object Re-identification: I leverage vision transformers to enhance object re-identification, allowing for more accurate and efficient recognition of objects across different scenarios.

    Image Segmentation/Classification: I'm adept at segmenting images into meaningful regions and classifying objects within these segments, enabling detailed analysis and understanding.

### Game Development

In the realm of game development, I've worked on exciting projects:

    C++ (Pinball-Space Project): I've contributed to the creation of engaging games using C++. One of my notable projects includes the Pinball-Space game.

    Python (Tic Tac Toe and Connect4 Projects): I've crafted interactive games like Tic Tac Toe and Connect4 using Python, combining fun and learning in an accessible format.


Feel free to explore my repository to see these skills in action and witness the intersection of creativity and technology. 

#### I'm always eager to collaborate and explore new challenges, so don't hesitate to reach out!
Amany :)
